#           Network:
#           -As i have noted previously a networks are things (machines, computers,...) connected, Networking skills 
#           will give you the full understading it's like a super power for an penetration tester or red teamer. 
#
#                   (this intro may look boring for ppl who knows already about networking)
#               
#                   
#           Internet:
#           -it's just connection between networks with diff devices printers phones laptops servers routers.
#              when we say connection this means that the devices communicate between them so they need to know each other,
#           devices are identifed by two things ip address and Mac address as we humans are identified by our names and 
#           finger prints names we can change them if we have decided to but our fingerprint i dont think so.
#
#
#           IP address:
#           -the ip address can be used to identify a host in a network for a period of time(since alot of devices use DHCP
#           we will cover this dont worry hero).
#
#
#               in case you have never heard about bits, octets i'll give an explanation but it doesn't mean you dont need
#               to search about it on google.
#                       -so bits is a numeric unit it can have only one of this two states "0" or "1".
#                       -everything can be converted to bits from colors to decimals.
#                       -the value given after a converssion we call it binary.
#                       -octets is a a sequence of 8 bits.
#
#
#               An ip address is a set of numbers that are devided into four octets it can have decimal values from 000 to
#               this value can be calculate by a technique called Ip adressing and subnetting.
#               if it sound too much informations for now all you need to know is that an ip address can change from device 
#               to device but cannot be simutaneously more than once within the same network
#           
#           MAC Addresses
#
#        -Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the 
#        device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, 
#        called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number 
#        (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated
#        by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six characters 
#        represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
#
#
#
#
#          -Ping:(ICMP):
#
#          Ping is the most used fundamental network tool available in every OS, it use ICMP (internet controle message protocol)
#          packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices if it exist,
#          The time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping.
#          so to use ping just write on your terminal "ping Ipaddress or website url" yes even if you have only an url you can 
#          ping it because we have another protocol DNS who can give name a domain name to every ip address since we humans 
#          we can remember words better than digits. 
#
#
#
#           -LAN Topologies:
#           when we talk about topologies we are talking about the design or the look of the network.
#
#               Star topology:
#                   the main idea about this topology is that every device is connected individualy via a central networking 
#                   device such as switch or a hub. this topolpgy is the most used nowadays because of it reliabilty and the
#                   cost 
#                   Cons:
#                       since every device is conncete individualy it means that it will need his own equipment such as cables
#                       and a port to connect with the central networking device
#                   Pros:
#                       it is easy to escale the network add or remove devices from the network but dont forget the more the network
#                       the more it need maintenace also it will make trouble shooting much harder.
#
#
#           -Bus Topology:
#            this type of connection it use ony one cable that connect between all the devices and it send data to all the machines
#            not only the dest, this topology give a slow connection since devices can use the cable at the same time, it will also 
#            give you a hard to for main.
#            however bus topolgy is the most cost efficient topologies caz we dont have no central Networking device and we use only
#            one cable to connncet the whole end-points.
#
#
#
#
#           -Ring Topology:
#           also known as token topology there is some similarities as Devices are derictly connected with each other through a loop
#           meaning that there is a little cabling required but not as much as star topology.
#           this topolgy works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the device wanted by it IP
#
#
#
#           What is a Switch?
#
#           Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, 
#           printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet. These various devices plug into a switch's port.
#           Switches are usually found in larger networks such as businesses, schools, or similar-sized networks, where there are
#           many devices to connect to the network. Switches can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24,
#            32, and 64 for devices to plug into.
#
#           next ill talk about some protocols and we will get a lil deeper in the osi model
