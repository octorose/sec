##          as a junior Security analyst you will be monitoring the event logs and alerts, as a 1Tier SOC you will have      ##
##          some responsabilities as Monitoring and investigating the alerts, Configuring and managing the security tools    ##
##          Developing and implimenting IDS "Intusion Detection system" signatures, working in SOC groups, create Tickets    ##
##          & escalate the security incidents to the Tier2 and team leader if needed.                                        ##
##          UUUUGH     i forgot to note i was diving so deep in  the tools we can use as SOC level1 i am really fascinated   ##
##          Sorry about this ill try to recapulate my 5h i got in the flow                                                   ##
##          first we discovered a platform called Feedly that will help us to stay updated since we are th frontliner we     ##
##          need to know more about strategies and techniques cybercriminals work with                                       ##

##          A soc also uses SIEM "security information and event managment" & EDR(Endpoint Detection and Response)           ##
##          these tools are made for monitoring suspicious and malicious network activities and it prioritize em from Hight  ##
##          to low level alerts.                                                                                             ##
##          i got into hashes too hashes are like numerical value that identify data this value have a fixed length by type  ##
##          of hashing in this room i had the chance to know three of them :                                                 ##
##              -MD5(Message digest): this method of hashing is wildly used in cryptoghraphic hashing function with 128bits  ##
##          they are not considered as cryptoghraphically secure, this type of hashing have a collision problem.             ##
##              -SHA-1 this methode of hashing is banned it was used for digital signatures at the end of 2013 but NIST      ##
##          found that it was vulnerable to brute forcing.                                                                   ##
##              -Sha-2 this hashing algo was designed by the NIST to replace the SHA-1 this method have a lot of variants as ##
##          Sha-256 this algo return a hash with the length of 256bits and 64 hexadecimal number.                            ##
##          in this room they have montionned some ressources about intrusions , also they gave some online tools to hash    ##

##              so to explain this technic the attacker knows that his IP adress can be shown on the logs and he can be      ##
##              blocked so why not to  create a script that will change the A records in the dns and also decrease the TTL   ##
##              so the Ip adress associated to my domain name can change frequently to keep my phishing attack up            ##
##            typosquatting domain names (Facbook.com) is a technique for physhing .                                         ##

##             the attacker will need to circle  back this detection level and change the attack tools and methodology       ##
##             and it's very time consuming for the attacker. host artificats are the traces or observables the attacker     ##
