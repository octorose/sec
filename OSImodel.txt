#                                                                                                                                                   ##
#           -What is the osi mode?
#           Open System Interconncetion model is a fundamental model used in networking, this model will give us an overview                        ##
#           about how the devices will send, receive and interpret data data sent across a network that follows the                                 ##
#           the uniformity of an OSI model can be understood by other devices.                                                                      ##
#           the Osi model consists of seven layers which are : physical, data link, network, transport, session, Presentation                       ##
#                                                                                                                                                   ##
#           at every layer that the data travel through, a specific process take place and we add to it a piece of information                      ##
#           We call this process encapsulation.
#
#
#
#            -Application layer:
#            this is the seventh layer that you be most familiar with coz that the layer in which the protocol decide how the                       ##
#            have to interact with data sent or received. Every application such as email and browsers... they have a friendly                      ##
#            GUI for user to interact with the data received and sent. use such as Apllication layer protocols as DNS                               ##
#            
#            -Session Layer:
#            the session layer have to beging the creation of the connection with the other computer that the data is destineted##
#            for . so when a connection is established => a session is created.
#            the session layer sychronises the connection between the dest and source computers the session leayer will make sure                   ##
#            both of the computers are in the same page before data sent and received, the Session layer will divide up the data                    ##
#            sent into small chunks of data & begin to send those chunks(packets).
#
#
#            -Transport Layer:
#            this layer plays a vital part in transmitting data across a network this layer use one of
#            these two protocols:
#               TCP: 
#               Transmission Control Protocol this protocol is designed with reliability and guarantee in mind.
#               it needs a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it take for the data to be sent.
#                   -Pros:
#                   Guarantees the accuracy of data.
#                   capable of sychronizing two devices to prevent the other from being flooded with data.
#                   Perform a lot more processes for reliability.
#                   -Cons:
#                   a slow connection can Bottlneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the reciving
#                   computer the whole time
#
#
#                UDP: USer Datagram Protocol, this protocol is not nearly as advaced as the TCP in another words
#                   UDP is the chad it doesn't give a shit about if u have received the data or not.
#
#
#            -Network Layer:
#            in this layer we determine the most optimal path that the data have to take we call this process routing                                ##
#            & also we re-assemble the little chunks made from the Session Layer so if we had a problem of connection
#            we can only resend the first chunks we have missed and not the whole data, in this layer we will re-assemble
#            them into a larger chunks,
#                   Protocols:
#                   Network layer uses  protocols such as OSPF ( Open shortest Path First )and RIP (Routing information Protocol)                    ##
#                           OSPF:it a protocole who cares about the fastest or shortest path, it collect link state information from available       ##
#                       routers and it construct a topology map, it's represented as a table, it can change the topology in case of a link failure   ##
#                       and it converge on a new loop-free routing structure. this protocole uses Djikstra algorithme to calcualte the shorest path  ##
#                       when am saying the shortest path so the distance is the cost to reach a router (the cost is inversely proportional to the    ##
#                       bandwidth of the link ).
#                           RIP: is a protocole that use litteraly the distance and it's calculated by the number of hops (how many router we have   ## 
#                       in this Path).
#                   In this layer everything is dealt with via IP addresses . Devices as routers capableof delivering packets using IP addresses are ##
#                   are known as Layer 3 devices.
#            -Data Link:
#            this layer focuses on the physical addressing when we talk about  physical adressing this means we are going to pull out the word "MAC  ##
#            adresses", inside every NIC (network interface card) it comes with a unique MAc address. they can be changed but ehm they can be spoofed##
#            so be carfule.
#            -physical Layer:
#            this layer only make reference to the physical components of the hardware used in the networking
