# Security Operations Center (SOC):
# it's a team that monitor network and system for security threats and respond to them.
# SOC is a centralized location where security professionals monitor and analyze security events.
# the main areas of SOC are:
# 1-Vulnerability .
# 2-Policy violations.
# 3-Unauthorized access.
# 4-Network intrusion.

# Threat intelligence:
# it's a process of collecting, analyzing, and using information about an adversary's tactics, techniques,
#  and procedures (TTPs).
# the informations or the data collection is done from local and external sources:
# 1-network logs.
# 2-public sources as forums.

# Processing the data is done by aranging it in a format suitable for analysis.
# the analysis aims to creat a list of recommendations and actions to be taken to prevent the threat.

# Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR):
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Digital forensics:
# it's the application of investigation crimes and establish facts.
#  they focus on different areas:
# 1-File System: analyzing a digital forensic image.this one reveals the files and folders that were
#  created, deleted, or modified.
# 2-System memory: it's the volatile memory of the system.sometime attackers dont store their data in
#  the file system, they store it in the memory.
# 3-SysLog:each client server  device has a log file that records the events that occur on
#  the device. the attacker will leave a traceeven if the attacker tries to clear theire traces.
# 4-Network logs:logs of the network packets that are sent and received by the network devices.

# Incident response:
# an incident is an event that has a negative impact on the organization. it can be a security breach,
#  a virus, or a denial of service attack. and it can be something less serious like a misconfiguration
# or an instrusion attempt, or a poicy violation.
#  there is 4 major phases to respond to an incident:
# 1-Preparation: it's the phase where the organization prepares for an incident.
# 2-Detection: it's the phase where the organization detects an incident.
# 3-Containment: it's the phase where the organization contains the incident.
# 4-Post-incident activity: it's the phase where the organization analyzes the incident and producting a report.
