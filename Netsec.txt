#           
#           -Definition:
#
#       a network is a group of computers and devicesconnected to each others and the security of networks 
#       means protecting those devices and computers from attackers and also protecting it from a misuse from the 
#       employees.
#       the network security consists of different hardware and software solutions 
#
#           -Example of Hardware solutions:
#
#       Firewall appliance: the firewall give permission and block to sockets internaly or externaly basing on
#       predefined set of rules.
#       Inrusion Detection System(IDS): an IDS detects attackers ettempts to get into the network or into the System.
#       Virtual Private Network(VPN): this appliance provide the secrecy and confidentiality of the data whiche means 
#       it cannot be read nor altered by a third party.
#
#
#           -Example of Software solutions:
#
#       Antivirus software: they are able to detect malwares to block them from executing
#       Host firewall:yes there is a software version of the firewall its a host program that you install in your System
#       as an Example Windows Defender Firewall 
#
#
#           -Methodology:
#       
#       for every Inrusion ettempts it requires some planning or as we call a Chyber kill chainm it contain seven steps:
#       -Recon: this refers to the step where the attacker have to collect data and learn as much as possible about the target
#           informations as types of servers, operating system, ip adresses, name of users.
#       -Weaponization: this means preparing the file with the chain of attacks or with a malicious componenet as an example 
#           providing the attacker with remote access
#       -Delivery: this means how the weaponized file can reach the target via any feasible method.
#       -Exploitation: Execution of the malicious file.
#       -Installation: the execution of the file should install the malware on the target system this means if we have used the 
#           usb as a deleveriy method it must be installed in the targrt system.
#       -C2(commande and control): the successful installation  give to the attacker an ability to command and controle the whole
#           system.
#       -Actions and objectifs: if the attacker has the control over the target's system, he has achieved their objectives
#               Data Exfiltration(stealing target's data).
