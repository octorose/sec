THIS NOTES HERE ARE MORE ADVANCED THIS ONE IS NOT AN TRYHACKME NOTE IT JUST I WAS ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT HOW TO SECURE 
THE CONNECTIVITY OF MY IOT PROJECTS SUCH AS THE RESPIRATOR ONE.

##                                                                                                                     ##
##             Websockets:                                                                                             ##
##      it's a fullduplex&asychronous connection made between client and a server . the HTTP protocole is used to      ##
##      initialize the connection between the client and the server, after that the connection is upgraded to a        ##
##      persistent Websocket connection to transmit asychronously data. Websockets connections are initialized only    ##
##      once to give them the speed advantage so it is used for real-time data such as health care usage or gaming...  ##
##                                                                                                                     ##
##                                                                                                                     ##
##              Secure Websockets:                                                                                     ##
##      As we have said earlier Websocket use http protocole so it can be either encrypted or unencrypted, Websockets  ##
##      also suport both and we call it WS for an unencrypted Websocket and WSS for an encrypted Websocket over TLS    ##
##                                                                                                                     ##
##                                                                                                                     ##
##              Websocket Request:                                                                                     ##
##      A Websocket request can be request with a client-side javaScript using the Websocket object:                   ##
##              websocket = new WebSocket('wss://chatbot.com/chat');                                                   ##
##                                                                                                                     ##
##      Or in my case using ESP32 so C++ it is :                                                                       ##
